## Running

This program requires [python 3](https://www.python.org/) to run. Paste the 
contents of [Frankenstein by Mary Wollstonecraft (Godwin) Shelley](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asweigart/codebreaker/master/frankenstein.txt)
into a file under `./books/frankenstein.txt` and you are all set to go!
